## Introduction

The VS Code Webview Toolkit is a component library made specifically for building webview-based extensions in VS Code.

This toolkit was created to give people the tools to build webview experiences that are consistent with the rest of VS Code. Features of the library include:

-   **Implements The VS Code Design Language:** All components implement the VS Code design language, enabling developers to create extensions that have a consistent look and feel with the rest of VS Code.
-   **Theming As A First Class Citizen:** All of the components were designed with theming in mind and the toolkit ships with utilities that automatically consume and apply VS Code color theme changes.
-   **Plays Nice With Your Tech Stack:** The library is built with web components meaning no matter what tech stack your using (React, Svelte, Vanilla JS, etc.) the component library will play nice.
-   **Accessible Out Of The Box:** All components ship with web standard compliant ARIA labels and keyboard navigation meaning you don't have to worry about accessibility.
